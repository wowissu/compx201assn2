Binary

Binary
The base 2 number system. Integer can be encoded as binary which is a string of 0's and 1's. Binary is a place-value system in which each bit position denotes a power of 2 (unlike decimal which uses 10 symbols and powers of 10). k bits of information can represent 2k different numbers. For example counting in 3 bits of binary you can count from 0 to 7, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.
